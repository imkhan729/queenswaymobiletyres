## 🏗️ 1. Platform Analysis: Where to Invest?

### 🏆 Primary Platform: Google Ads (Search)
**Verdict:** **ESSENTIAL (90% of Budget)**
*   **Why?** Mobile tyre fitting is an "immediate need" service. When a driver gets a flat tyre on the M25 or discovers a puncture before work, they search Google immediately. They have high intent to buy *right now*.
*   **Goal:** Capture users searching for "emergency tyre fitting" or "mobile tyres near me".

### 🥈 Secondary Platform: Google Business Profile (Maps)
**Verdict:** **CRITICAL (Free/Low Cost)**
*   **Why?** Local SEO. Appearing in the "Map Pack" (top 3 map results) builds massive trust.
*   **Action:** Ensure your GMB profile is verified, hours are set to 24/7, and you are actively getting 5-star reviews.

### 🥉 Tertiary Platform: Facebook / Instagram
**Verdict:** **OPTIONAL (10% of Budget - Retargeting Only)**
*   **Why?** People don't usually scroll Instagram looking for tyre repair. Social media is better for "convenience" awareness (e.g., "Don't waste Saturday at a garage") rather than emergency response.
*   **Action:** Run simple retargeting ads to people who visited your site but didn't call.

## 🎯 2. Competitor & Market Research (Herts & North London)

### The Competition
1.  **National Giants (Kwik Fit, Halfords, Blackcircles):** 
    *   *Weakness:* Often have long lead times (next day or 2-day booking), expensive, impersonal.
    *   *Your Advantage:* **Speed (30-60 mins)**, **Personal Service**, **24/7 Availability**.
2.  **Local Aggregators:**
    *   *Weakness:* Lead generation sites that sell leads to other fitters.
    *   *Your Advantage:* You are the direct provider. Trustworthy.

### Your Winning Angle (USP)
*   **"We arrive in 60 minutes"** (Beats the nationals).
*   **"We cover M1/M25 Emergencies"** (High value jobs).
*   **"Local to Watford/St Albans"** (Builds local trust).

## 💰 3. READYMADE GOOGLE ADS CAMPAIGN (Copy-Paste Setup)

**Use these exact settings to set up your first campaign.**

### ⚙️ Campaign Settings

*   **Budget:** Start with **£30 - £50 per day**.

    *   **Specific Areas:** Watford, St Albans, Hemel Hempstead, Harrow, Barnet, Edgware, Uxbridge, Luton.

## 🔄 5. Routine Optimization (Weekly) - How to Rank #1

1.  **Check Search Terms:** Go to "Keywords" -> "Search Terms". This shows what people *actually* typed.
    *   *Action:* If you see "bicycle tyre repair", add "bicycle" as a Negative Keyword.
    *   *Action:* If you see "cheap tyres watford" and you are premium, exclude "cheap".
2.  **Bid Adjustments:**
    *   If mobile users convert better (they usually do for emergency tyres), increase the Bid Adjustment for Mobile devices by +10% or +20%.
3.  **Schedule:**
    *   Check which hours get the most calls. If 2am is dead but expensive, turn ads off during that time or lower bids.
