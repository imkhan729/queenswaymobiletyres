              The 7°C Rule
            </h2>
            <p>
              The most critical thing to understand is the "7 degree rule", explained in detail by manufacturers like <a href="https://www.continental-tires.com/products/b2c/tire-knowledge/winter-tires/7-degree-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-primary hover:underline">Continental</a>.

                <p className="text-sm">Below 7°C, the rubber in standard summer tyres hardens like plastic. This significantly reduces grip and increases braking distances.</p>

              Sipes: The Secret Weapon
            </h2>
            <p>
              If you look closely at a winter tyre, you will see thousands of tiny wiggly slits in the tread blocks. These are called <strong>sipes</strong>. As the tyre rotates, these sipes open up and bite into snow, slush, and ice, providing traction that a smooth block summer tyre simply cannot match.

              Are All-Season Tyres the Answer?
            </h2>
            <p>
              For many London drivers, swapping tyres twice a year is a hassle. Enter the <strong>All-Season Tyre</strong>.

              These are a hybrid design. They won't perform as well as a pure winter tyre in deep Scottish snow, nor as well as a summer tyre on a hot track day. But for the variable British weather—wet, chilly, occasional slush—they are an increasingly popular "fit and forget" solution.

              <li><strong>Pros:</strong> No need to store a second set of wheels; capable in light snow.</li>
